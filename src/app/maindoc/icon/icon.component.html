    <h4>Icon</h4>
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>mat-icon makes it easier to use vector-based icons in your app. This directive supports both icon fonts and SVG icons, but not bitmap-based formats (png, jpg, etc.).</p>
    <div class="example">
        <mat-icon aria-hidden="false" aria-label="Example home icon">home</mat-icon>
    </div>
    <pre><code [highlight]="codeex" class="p-2"></code></pre>
    <h6>Registering icons</h6>
<p>MatIconRegistry is an injectable service that allows you to associate icon names with SVG URLs, HTML strings and to define aliases for CSS font classes. Its methods are discussed below and listed in the API summary.</p>
<h6>Font icons with ligatures</h6>
<p>Some fonts are designed to show icons by using ligatures, for example by rendering the text "home" as a home image. To use a ligature icon, put its text in the content of the mat-icon component.</p>
<p>By default, mat-icon expects the Material icons font. (You will still need to include the HTML to load the font and its CSS, as described in the link). You can specify a different font by setting the fontSet input to either the CSS class to apply to use the desired font, or to an alias previously registered with MatIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias.</p>
<h6>Font icons with CSS</h6>
<p>Fonts can also display icons by defining a CSS class for each icon glyph, which typically uses a :before selector to cause the icon to appear. FontAwesome uses this approach to display its icons. To use such a font, set the fontSet input to the font's CSS class (either the class itself or an alias registered with MatIconRegistry.registerFontClassAlias), and set the fontIcon input to the class for the specific icon to show.</p>
<p>For both types of font icons, you can specify the default font class to use when fontSet is not explicitly set by calling MatIconRegistry.setDefaultFontSetClass.</p>

<h6>SVG icons</h6>
<p>mat-icon displays SVG icons by directly inlining the SVG content into the DOM as a child of itself. This approach offers an advantage over an <img> tag or a CSS background-image because it allows styling the SVG with CSS. For example, the default color of the SVG content is the CSS currentColor value. This makes SVG icons by default have the same color as surrounding text, and allows you to change the color by setting the color style on the mat-icon element.</p>

<p>In order to guard against XSS vulnerabilities, any SVG URLs and HTML strings passed to the MatIconRegistry must be marked as trusted by using Angular's DomSanitizer service.</p>
    
<p>MatIconRegistry fetches all remote SVG icons via Angular's HttpClient service. If you haven't included HttpClientModule from the @angular/common/http package in your NgModule imports, you will get an error at runtime.</p>
    
<p>Note that HttpClient fetches SVG icons registered with a URL via XmlHttpRequest, subject to the Same-origin policy. This means that icon URLs must have the same origin as the containing page or that the application's server must be configured to allow cross-origin requests.</p>
<h6>Named icons</h6>
<p>To associate a name with an icon URL, use the addSvgIcon, addSvgIconInNamespace, addSvgIconLiteral or addSvgIconLiteralInNamespace methods of MatIconRegistry. After registering an icon, it can be displayed by setting the svgIcon input. For an icon in the default namespace, use the name directly. For a non-default namespace, use the format [namespace]:[name].</p>
<h6> Icon sets</h6>
<p>Icon sets allow grouping multiple icons into a single SVG file. This is done by creating a single root svg tag that contains multiple nested svg tags in its defs section. Each of these nested tags is identified with an id attribute. This id is used as the name of the icon.</p>
<p>Icon sets are registered using the addSvgIconSet, addSvgIconSetInNamespace, addSvgIconSetLiteral or addSvgIconSetLiteralInNamespace methods of MatIconRegistry. After an icon set is registered, each of its embedded icons can be accessed by their id attributes. To display an icon from an icon set, use the svgIcon input in the same way as for individually registered icons.</p>
<p>Multiple icon sets can be registered in the same namespace. Requesting an icon whose id appears in more than one icon set, the icon from the most recently registered set will be used.</p>
<h6>Theming</h6>
<p>By default, icons will use the current font color (currentColor). this color can be changed to match the current theme's colors using the color attribute. This can be changed to 'primary', 'accent', or 'warn'.</p>
<h4>Accessibility</h4>
<p>Similar to an img element, an icon alone does not convey any useful information for a screen-reader user. The user of mat-icon must provide additional information pertaining to how the icon is used. Based on the use-cases described below, mat-icon is marked as aria-hidden="true" by default, but this can be overridden by adding aria-hidden="false" to the element.</p>
<p>In thinking about accessibility, it is useful to place icon use into one of three categories:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Decorative</strong>: the icon conveys no real semantic meaning and is purely cosmetic.</li>
    <li><strong>Interactive</strong>: a user will click or otherwise interact with the icon to perform some action.</li>
    <li><strong>Indicator</strong>: the icon is not interactive, but it conveys some information, such as a status.
    This includes using the icon in place of text inside of a larger message.</li>
</ol>
<h6>Decorative icons</h6>
<p>When the icon is purely cosmetic and conveys no real semantic meaning, the mat-icon element is marked with aria-hidden="true".</p>
    <h6>Interactive icons</h6>
    <p>Icons alone are not interactive elements for screen-reader users; when the user would interact with some icon on the page, a more appropriate element should "own" the interaction:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The <code>&lt;mat-icon&gt;</code> element should be a child of a <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element.</li>
        <li>The parent <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> should either have a meaningful label provided either through
        direct text content, <code>aria-label</code>, or <code>aria-labelledby</code>.</li>
        </ul>
</div>
